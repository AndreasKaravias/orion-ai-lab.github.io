I am currently a graduate student at the Dept. of Rural, Surveying and Geoinformatics Engineering at National Technical University of Athens. 

As a part of my MEng program I worked on Remote Sensing projects, especially with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image data. In Orion lab I have focused on wildfire burnt-scar mapping using Machine Learning algorithms with Python.

My goal is to participate in Remote sensing applications with positive social impact.
