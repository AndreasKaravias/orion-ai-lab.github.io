Graduated from the Physics department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 2022.
Currently completing an MSc in Data Science provided by NCSR Demokritos - University of Peloponnese.

As a Machine Learning Researcher at Orion Lab I am interested in using Deep Learning on Earth Observation data to contribute to research with high socio-environmental impact.
