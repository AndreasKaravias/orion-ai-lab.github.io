I am a Senior Expert in operational system design, software application development and implementation, having an 18-year full time professional experience in design and operational implementation of remote sensing related information systems and scientific modelling software. 
I have actively participated and coordinated the Software Development over numerous European Commission and European Space Agency Research Programmes.

As a part of my undergraduate studies, I was a part of the Research Cluster of Applied Sciences at Manav Rachna University for two years. I've contributed to solutions, ideas and represented my work at national and international conferences on Atmospheric Physics and Seismology. Currently, I'm also working on the development of a prototype of Pink Bins, a global winning innovation at G-STIC Brussels, Belgium. I'm an innovator, a detail-oriented researcher, and a diligent software developer who innovates technological solutions to existing traditional problems in our society. I am always keen to explore and evaluate the under-represented domains of our community. 

I've worked at Gulftainer, UAE as an intern and learned about business analytics and how they drive decisions and understood the financial perspective of executing ideas. I have also helped bridge the gap for the textile printing company, Classic Prints, to move towards digital marketing and solutions to expand their customer base.

I believe integrating design, technology, science, and business is the only way to make sure innovation reaches the people who need it the most. I aspire to bring the change by ensuring all the research and technological growth is accessible and affordable to all economic sections of our society.
