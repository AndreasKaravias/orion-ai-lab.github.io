I have done an M.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens, which focused in software engineering, networks, computer science and statistics. Then, I completed a 2-year Erasmus Mundus MSc in Big Data Management and Analytics, studying in four beautiful European cities (Athens, Brussels, Barcelona, Berlin). I also spent 2 years at the borders of France and Switzerland developing software applications at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN).

In the past, my research was at the intersection of Big Data and Deep Learning. Currently, as a researcher at the Orion Lab, I am interested in Deep Learning for the Earth System sciences, aiming to improve fire prediction system.
