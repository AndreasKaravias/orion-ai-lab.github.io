Dr. Panagiotis Kosmopoulos is a Researcher at the Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable Development of the National Observatory of Athens in Greece. He received his BSc in Geology and MSc in Environmental Physics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and holds a PhD in Solar Radiation and Energy Forecasting from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He has a 20-year professional experience (>150 publications; h-index 23) through international projects and initiatives (e.g. ThinkingEarth, ClimSA, Cirocco, Eiffel, EuroGEO e-shape, ERA-PLANET Smurbs, COST InDust, GEO-Cradle Initiative, Siemens Aristotelis Solar, NSRF Kripis Thespia) followed by a total budget of >100 M €, from which >3.3 M € is related with the renewable energy sector. He exploits Earth observations, big data, artificial intelligence, advanced graphic creation platforms, short- and long-term forecasting approaches and high-performance computing for renewable energy technologies, solar spectral irradiance studies, urban planning, aerosol and cloud physics, smart grids, and all-scale (from big solar farms to rooftop photovoltaic installations) solar plants management and planning.
