Ioannis Karamitros is a structural geologist with practical experience in combining and analyzing geological fieldwork with 3D data sets. His research focus is on understanding the structure and growth of active normal faults by investigating their geometry and kinematics with the use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning technology and Photogrammetry. He is currently working on geohazards modeling using Persistent Scatterer Interferomtry, photogrammetry techniques and GNSS.
