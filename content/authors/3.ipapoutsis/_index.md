I am an electrical and computer engineer with a research focus on the field of Earth Observation and artificial intelligence through the processing of big volumes of satellite and geospatial data. I hold a PhD on the use of advanced satellite interferometry techniques. 

I am interested in AI4EO impactful applications , with a focus on Climate Change, natural disasters monitoring and earth system sciences. My current research focuses on the use of artificial intelligence/deep learning for knowledge extraction. 

I have participated to several research projects funded mainly from European Commission (H2020 and FP7), European Space Agency and Copernicus initiatives. Currently I am the coordinator of the H2020 project DeepCube and the ESA project SeasFire that focuses on AI pipelines for Copernicus data.
