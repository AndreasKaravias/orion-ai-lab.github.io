I received my BSc in Mathematics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 2013.

Afterwards I completed an MSc in Applied Mathematics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 2016 and a second Msc in Data Science from the Athens University of Economics and Business in 2017. Between 2018 and 2020 I worked as a professional Data Scientist in a conversational AI company.

I am currently a researcher at Orion Lab, applying Deep Learning to Earth system related applications, with a focus on Bayesian Deep Learning. My main field of interest is Wildfire Forecasting. In parallel, I am pursuing a PhD in University of Valencia.
