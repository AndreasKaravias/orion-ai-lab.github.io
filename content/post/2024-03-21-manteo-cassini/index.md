We are proud for our team members that won the [EUSPA cassini challenge](https://www.euspa.europa.eu/cassini-challenges-winners-2023) award for their startup idea - [manteo.ai](https://manteo.ai) - that aims to bring the power of Earth Observation to non-expert users.

[Manteo.ai](https://manteo.ai) is an innovative artificial intelligence system that provides easy access to Earth information via chat using satellite data. It combines large language models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) with AI models specialized in processing and analyzing satellite data. It answers questions related to Earth observation and undertakes complex tasks such as extreme weather risk estimation, natural disaster mapping, and monitoring of vegetation, ecosystems, and climate change indicators.

**[Manteo.ai](https://manteo.ai) wants to empower non-specialized users the ability to access information regarding satellite data, contributing to the democratization of knowledge about the status and evolution of our planet.**
