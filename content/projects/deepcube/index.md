NOA/OrionLab coordinates this project that employs novel artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to address problems of high socio-environmental impact and enhance our understanding of Earthâ€™s processes correlated with Climate Change. DeepCube develops hybrid Deep Learning architectures for data-driven models that respect physical laws, and opens up the Deep Learning black box with Explainable AI and Causality.
