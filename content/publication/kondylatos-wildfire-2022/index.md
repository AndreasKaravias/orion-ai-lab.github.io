abstract: Abstract Climate change exacerbates the occurence of extreme droughts and
  heatwaves, increasing the frequency and intensity of large wildfires across the
  globe. Forecasting wildfire danger and uncovering the drivers behind fire events
  become central for understanding relevant climate‐land surface feedback and aiding
  wildfire management. In this work, we leverage Deep Learning (DL) to predict the
  next day's wildfire danger in a fire‐prone part of the Eastern Mediterranean and
  explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) to diagnose model attributions. We implement
  DL models that capture the temporal and spatio‐temporal context, generalize well
  for extreme wildfires, and demonstrate improved performance over the traditional
  Fire Weather Index. Leveraging xAI, we identify the substantial contribution of
  wetness‐related variables and unveil the temporal focus of the models. The variability
  of the contribution of the input variables across wildfire events hints into different
  wildfire mechanisms. The presented methodology paves the way to more robust, accurate,
  and trustworthy data‐driven anticipation of wildfires. ,  Plain Language Summary
  Climate change drives the aggravation of wildfires globally. In this context, it
  is crucial to better predict and understand wildfires. Our work proposes methods
  to accurately forecast wildfire danger and hints into the mechanisms that drive
  it. We use Machine Learning (ML) to predict next‐day wildfire danger, using meteorological,
  vegetation, and human‐related data, improving the results of the widely used Fire
  Weather Index, which is based only on meteorological forecasts. We then look to
  understand what the models have learned and how the different conditioning factors
  contribute to the final prediction. We find that ML models focus more on soil moisture
  and relative humidity for their predictions. They also take into account the cumulative
  temperature and precipitation, as well as the last day's wind speed and the relative
  humidity in the 2 days preceding fire ignition. These associations lead to new,
  data‐driven ways to anticipate wildfires. ,  Key Points    When forecasting fires
  that lead to large burned areas, Deep Learning models indicate higher predictive
  skill than the Fire Weather Index   Soil moisture, Normalized Difference Vegetation
  Index, and weather are the most important predictors; changes in their importance
  across events reveal diverse wildfire types   Models' explainability uncovers physically‐consistent
  associations and temporal dynamics of the fire drivers
