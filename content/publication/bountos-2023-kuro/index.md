abstract: 'Global floods, exacerbated by climate change, pose severe threats to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. This urgency is highlighted by recent catastrophic events in Pakistan and New Zealand, underlining the critical need for precise flood mapping for guiding restoration
efforts, understanding vulnerabilities, and preparing for future events. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers day-and-night, all-weather imaging capabilities, harnessing it for deep learning is hindered by the absence of a large annotated dataset. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kuro Siwo, a meticulously curated multi-temporal dataset, spanning 32 flood events globally. Our dataset maps more than 63 billion {{< math >}}$m^2${{< /math >}} of land, with 12.1 billion of them being either a flooded area or a permanent water body. Kuro Siwo stands out for its unparalleled annotation quality to
facilitate rapid flood mapping.'
