abstract: Climate change is expected to aggravate wildfire activity through the exacerbation
  of fire weather. Improving our capabilities to anticipate wildfires on a global
  scale is of uttermost importance for mitigating their negative effects. In this
  work, we create a global fire dataset and demonstrate a prototype for predicting
  the presence of global burned areas on a sub-seasonal scale with the use of segmentation
  deep learning models. Particularly, we present an open-access global analysis-ready
  datacube, which contains a variety of variables related to the seasonal and sub-seasonal
  fire drivers (climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, human-related variables), as
  well as the historical burned areas and wildfire emissions for 2001-2021. We train
  a deep learning model, which treats global wildfire forecasting as an image segmentation
  task and skillfully predicts the presence of burned areas 8, 16, 32 and 64 days
  ahead of time. Our work motivates the use of deep learning for global burned area
  forecasting and paves the way towards improved anticipation of global wildfire patterns.
