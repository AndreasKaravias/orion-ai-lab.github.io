abstract: 'We introduce Mesogeos, a large-scale multi-purpose dataset for wildfire
  modeling in the Mediterranean. Mesogeos integrates variables representing wildfire
  drivers (meteorology, vegetation, human activity) and historical records of wildfire
  ignitions and burned areas for 17 years (2006-2022). It is designed as a cloud-friendly
  spatio-temporal dataset, namely a datacube, harmonizing all variables in a grid
  of 1km x 1km x 1-day resolution. The datacube structure offers opportunities to
  assess machine learning (ML) usage in various wildfire modeling tasks. We extract
  two ML-ready datasets that establish distinct tracks to demonstrate this potential:
  (1) short-term wildfire danger forecasting and (2) final burned area estimation
  given the point of ignition. We define appropriate metrics and baselines to evaluate
  the performance of models in each track. By publishing the datacube, along with
  the code to create the ML datasets and models, we encourage the community to foster
  the implementation of additional tracks for mitigating the increasing threat of
  wildfires in the Mediterranean.'
