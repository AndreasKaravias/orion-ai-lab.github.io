	abstract = {We introduce Mesogeos, a large-scale multi-purpose dataset for wildfire modeling in the Mediterranean. Mesogeos integrates variables representing wildfire drivers (meteorology, vegetation, human activity) and historical records of wildfire ignitions and burned areas for 17 years (2006-2022). It is designed as a cloud-friendly spatio-temporal dataset, namely a datacube, harmonizing all variables in a grid of 1km x 1km x 1-day resolution. The datacube structure offers opportunities to assess machine learning ({ML}) usage in various wildfire modeling tasks. We extract two {ML}-ready datasets that establish distinct tracks to demonstrate this potential: (1) short-term wildfire danger forecasting and (2) final burned area estimation given the point of ignition. We define appropriate metrics and baselines to evaluate the performance of models in each track. By publishing the datacube, along with the code to create the {ML} datasets and models, we encourage the community to foster the implementation of additional tracks for mitigating the increasing threat of wildfires in the Mediterranean.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Climate change exacerbates the occurence of extreme droughts and heatwaves, increasing the frequency and intensity of large wildfires across the globe. Forecasting wildfire danger and uncovering the drivers behind fire events become central for understanding relevant climate‐land surface feedback and aiding wildfire management. In this work, we leverage Deep Learning ({DL}) to predict the next day's wildfire danger in a fire‐prone part of the Eastern Mediterranean and explainable Artificial Intelligence ({xAI}) to diagnose model attributions. We implement {DL} models that capture the temporal and spatio‐temporal context, generalize well for extreme wildfires, and demonstrate improved performance over the traditional Fire Weather Index. Leveraging {xAI}, we identify the substantial contribution of wetness‐related variables and unveil the temporal focus of the models. The variability of the contribution of the input variables across wildfire events hints into different wildfire mechanisms. The presented methodology paves the way to more robust, accurate, and trustworthy data‐driven anticipation of wildfires.

            Plain Language Summary
            Climate change drives the aggravation of wildfires globally. In this context, it is crucial to better predict and understand wildfires. Our work proposes methods to accurately forecast wildfire danger and hints into the mechanisms that drive it. We use Machine Learning ({ML}) to predict next‐day wildfire danger, using meteorological, vegetation, and human‐related data, improving the results of the widely used Fire Weather Index, which is based only on meteorological forecasts. We then look to understand what the models have learned and how the different conditioning factors contribute to the final prediction. We find that {ML} models focus more on soil moisture and relative humidity for their predictions. They also take into account the cumulative temperature and precipitation, as well as the last day's wind speed and the relative humidity in the 2 days preceding fire ignition. These associations lead to new, data‐driven ways to anticipate wildfires.

            Key Points
            
              
                
                  When forecasting fires that lead to large burned areas, Deep Learning models indicate higher predictive skill than the Fire Weather Index
                
                
                  Soil moisture, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and weather are the most important predictors; changes in their importance across events reveal diverse wildfire types
                
                
                  Models' explainability uncovers physically‐consistent associations and temporal dynamics of the fire drivers},

	abstract = {Wildfire forecasting is of paramount importance for disaster risk reduction and environmental sustainability. We approach daily fire danger prediction as a machine learning task, using historical Earth observation data from the last decade to predict next-day's fire danger. To that end, we collect, pre-process and harmonize an open-access datacube, featuring a set of covariates that jointly affect the fire occurrence and spread, such as weather conditions, satellite-derived products, topography features and variables related to human activity. We implement a variety of Deep Learning ({DL}) models to capture the spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal context and compare them against a Random Forest ({RF}) baseline. We find that either spatial or temporal context is enough to surpass the {RF}, while a {ConvLSTM} that exploits the spatio-temporal context performs best with a test Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic of 0.926. Our {DL}-based proof-of-concept provides national-scale daily fire danger maps at a much higher spatial resolution than existing operational solutions.},
