Orion Lab has developed deep learning methods for daily wildfire danger forecasting. We approach daily fire danger prediction as a machine learning task, using historical Earth observation data from the last decade to predict next-dayâ€™s fire danger. Our work aims at producing fire hazard forecasts at large scales and with better spatial resolution compared to other existing methods and operational tools.

We implement a variety of Deep Learning (DL) models to capture the spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal context and compare them against a Random Forest (RF) baseline and the fire weather index

Our DL-based proof-of-concept provides national-scale daily fire danger maps at a much higher spatial resolution than existing operational solutions.

We use *explainable Artificial Intelligence* methods on top of our DL models to gain more insights about the predictions. 
This allows us to answer important questions, for example: 
- which are the main drivers? 
- are there meaningful space/time patterns that increase fire risk? 
- are there ways to know how sure the model is about a prediction? 
- what is the impact of a change of a predictor on the fire risk?
