The Orion Lab was established in 2020 in Athens, inspired by the majestic Orion constellation. It symbolizes our mission to illuminate and navigate the complexities of Earth observation through artificial intelligence. The Orion constellation, one of the most prominent and recognizable patterns in the night sky, has guided explorers and astronomers for centuries with its striking clarity and reliability. Similarly, our lab aspires to be a beacon of innovation in AI for Earth observation (AI4EO).

In Greek mythology, Orion was a giant huntsman of great beauty and strength, placed among the stars by Zeus. According to legend, Orion was a skilled hunter who boasted of his ability to conquer any beast on Earth. His myth is intertwined with tales of adventure, love, and tragedy, reflecting the enduring human spirit of exploration and discovery. The constellation itself is often depicted as a figure brandishing a club and shield, eternally pursuing the constellation of the Pleiades across the sky.

Orion's story varies in different accounts, but one common theme is his tragic end, leading to his immortalization among the stars. Some myths say he was killed by a scorpion sent by the Earth goddess Gaia, leading to the creation of the Scorpius constellation. Others recount that Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, placed Orion in the heavens to honor his hunting prowess. This narrative of striving for greatness and being immortalized in the cosmos parallels our lab's dedication to pushing the boundaries of AI4EO and achieving a lasting impact.

By adopting the name Orion Lab, we embrace the constellationâ€™s legacy of guidance, excellence, and relentless pursuit of knowledge. Just as Orion the hunter roams the skies, our lab aims to explore new frontiers in AI and Earth observation, illuminating the path toward sustainable models and applications. The Orion constellation not only symbolizes our aspirations but also serves as a reminder of the limitless potential that lies ahead.
